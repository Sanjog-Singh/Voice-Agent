# Voice-Agent
Voice Agent is an Inbound AI Voice Agent built using Python, Ultravox.ai, Twilio and integrated with Zoho CRM.<br>
I have created this project during my Internship at Hybrid Workforces, Vadodara, Gujarat.<br>
This Agent works according to the System Prompt given by you.<br>
This Agent was earlier supposed to explain the Company's Products, answer the queries of clients and send a follow-up mail or schedule a meeting on Teams, Meet and Zoom and update this detail in Zoho CRM also.<br>
For Confidentiality, I have not included System Prompt Files and necessary Credentials of Ultravox.ai, Twilio and Zoho CRM.<br>
You can get free Ultravox.ai API Key, which will be valid for calls for 30 minutes only, from the below link.<br>
https://app.ultravox.ai/<br>
You also have to buy a Twilio Phone Number, you will be redirect to Twilio from the below link.<br>
https://www.twilio.com/en-us<br>
For calling purposes, you can download an app named 'Rebtel' from Google Play Store, which provides free and unlimited calling on USA phone number.<br>
So you can buy an American Phone Number from Twilio.<br>
You also need to setup your 'ngrok' to run this agent, have a url and add it in your Twilio Webhook URL. You will be redirect to ngrok website from the below link.<br>
https://ngrok.com/<br>
This Agent is also integrated to Zoho CRM, but you also have to setup a Zoho Flow to receive an email link on your device. You will be redirect to Zoho CRM and Zoho Flow website from the below link.<br>
